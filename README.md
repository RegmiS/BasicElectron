### Major roadblocks
Ran into a major error with module handling where it woun't let me use imports and it keeps saying there are 
reference errors. I've run into this problems with previous projects when attempting to do the same thing, and it's caused by packaging problems and folder structure. Going to put a pin on this project for now since I can't figure out how to solve this and come back to it when I have an idea for how to figure out the module/es6/packaging/importing error
