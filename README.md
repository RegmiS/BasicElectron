# BasicElectron
Basic electron app, built using following a tutorial


## Followed using [tutorial](https://www.twilio.com/blog/an-introduction-to-building-desktop-applications-with-electron)

### Major roadblocks
Ran into a major error with module handling where it woun't let me use imports and it keeps saying there are 
reference errors. I've run into this problems with previous projects when attempting to do the same thing, and it's caused by packaging problems and folder structure. Going to put a pin on this project for now since I can't figure out how to solve this and come back to it when I have an idea for how to figure out the module/es6/packaging/importing error

#### Updates for the major roadblock:
It seems that the way that module/package has changed since tutorials were previously written, or it is simply my lack of knowledge that prevents me from using it correctly. Either way, it seems that I need to learn about how file structuring is normally done in electron, and maybe even node/js. This means that the next thing to learn is not necessarily more electron information, but instead how to structure a electron product correctly and what packages to use, like I did in [RegmiS/NodeCrud2](https://github.com/RegmiS/NodeCrud2)
